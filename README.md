# What You Need to Know Before Starting to Learn Flutter

## **Understanding the Mobile Development Landscape:**

Before diving into Flutter, it's essential to understand the broader mobile development landscape, including key terms like "cross-platform," "native," and the available options:

### **Cross-Platform Development:**

- Cross-platform development involves creating mobile applications that can run on multiple operating systems (e.g., Android and iOS) using a single codebase. Flutter is a leading cross-platform framework, making it possible to write one codebase for both Android and iOS applications.

### **Native Development:**

- Native development involves creating mobile apps specifically for one platform (either Android or iOS) using the respective platform's programming languages and tools (Java/Kotlin for Android and Swift/Objective-C for iOS).

### **Available Options for Cross-Platform Development:**

1. **Flutter:** As mentioned, Flutter is a robust framework for cross-platform development. It uses the Dart programming language and offers a wide range of pre-built widgets, making it relatively easy to create visually appealing and performant applications.
2. **React Native:** Another popular cross-platform framework developed by Facebook, React Native, allows you to build mobile apps using JavaScript and React. It's widely used in the industry and has a large community of developers.
3. **Xamarin:** Xamarin is a Microsoft-owned framework that allows developers to build cross-platform apps using C#. It provides a high level of code reusability and integrates well with the Microsoft ecosystem.
4. **PhoneGap/Cordova:** These frameworks enable the development of cross-platform apps using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They provide a webview that runs the app's user interface.
5. **NativeScript:** NativeScript allows you to create cross-platform apps using JavaScript, TypeScript, or Angular. It provides direct access to native APIs, offering a high degree of flexibility.

# **Prerequisite**

## **Basic Programming Knowledge:**

You should have a solid foundation in basic programming principles. Even if you're new to programming, these concepts will be invaluable as you embark on your Flutter journey:

### **a. Variables and Data Types:**

- Learn how to declare and use variables, as well as understand different data types such as integers, strings, and booleans.

### **b. Control Structures:**

- Gain proficiency in using control structures like if statements, switch statements, for and while loops, to control the flow of your programs.

### **c. Functions/Methods:**

- Understand how to define and call functions/methods, which are reusable blocks of code. Functions are vital for organizing your code effectively.

### **d. Debugging:**

- Learn how to troubleshoot and fix errors in your code. Debugging is a crucial skill that will save you a lot of time and frustration.

### **e. Version Control:**

- Familiarize yourself with version control systems like Git. This will help you track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and work on projects efficiently.

## **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Language:**

Before you start learning Flutter, it's essential to have a good grasp of an object-oriented programming language. The reason for this is that Flutter itself is developed using Dart, an object-oriented language. Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

In summary, before you start your journey into Flutter development, make sure you have a strong grasp of an object-oriented programming language and the fundamental programming concepts. This foundational knowledge will greatly ease your transition into Flutter, allowing you to focus on learning the framework itself and creating incredible mobile applications.

Understanding the mobile development landscape, including the concepts of cross-platform and native development, and being aware of the available options, will also help you make informed decisions about which technology to use for your projects.
